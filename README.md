# Sorting Visualization

This project is a sorting algorithms visualization created by [lazy-coder-03](https://github.com/lazy-coder-03). It provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms and allows users to interact with the visualization.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lazy-coder-03/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualization.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Sorting-Algorithms-Visualization
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

Once you have the project running, you can use the sorting visualization as follows:

- Choose a sorting algorithm from the "Sorting Algorithm" dropdown menu.
- Adjust the number of rectangles using the "Number of Rectangles" slider.
- Adjust the animation delay using the "Animation Delay (ms)" slider.
- Click the "Start Sorting" button to initiate the sorting process.
- Click the "Randomize" button to randomize the values in the visualization.

The sorting process will be visualized on the screen, and the statistics such as swaps, time elapsed, and comparisons will be displayed.
